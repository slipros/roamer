// Package formatter provides value formatters for post-processing parsed data.
// Formatters allow transforming values after they have been parsed from HTTP requests,
// such as trimming strings, converting case, or applying other transformations.
//
// The package is designed to be extensible, allowing users to create custom formatters
// for specific needs.
